  2.2 provide s3 path where you have uploaded above CloudFormation script <br />
  2.3 Provide values for below given parameters: <br />
    - clutserId- provide clusterid copied from above the step <br />
    - host - provide databricks workspace URL without https <br />
    - lambdas3path - provide s3 path of lambda zip archive file <br />
    - language - let the language be sql <br />
